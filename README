This is the course repository. 
Each directory contains a brief description of its purpose.


A small note regarding git: you should execute the following from a terminal window when within your git repostiory (comp618)

git config --global user.name "Michael Hallett"
git config --global user.email "michael.t.hallett@mcgill.ca"

But ... use your name/email ....
