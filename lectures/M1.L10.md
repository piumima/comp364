Previously (Lecture 5) ... Importing a csv file into R
========================================================
- A typical situation is that you have a spreadsheet, or simply a file
that contains information about a set of objects.
- <code>csv</code> is a common code for storing information in files (comma separated values)
- For example, the set of genes that are used in Oncotype Dx. (up in bad outcome)<br>
<tiny><code>
GeneName,Direction
CCNB1,up<br>
MKI67,up<br>
MYBL2,up<br>
AURKA,up<br>
BIRC5,up<br>
ERBB2,up<br>
GRB7,up<br>
CTSL2,up<br>
MMP11,up<br>
CD68,up<br>
BCL2,down<br>
SCUBE2,down<br>
ESR1,down<br>
PGR,down<br>
BAG1,down<br>
GSTM1,down<br>
</code></tiny>



Revisited: Importing a csv file into R (2)
========================================================
- This is your typical csv file that can be generated from Excel, Numbers, etc.
- we assume that this file is named <code>oncotypedx.csv</code>
- we assume it's located in our working directory (eg ~/repos/comp364)

































```
Error in setwd("~/repos/comp364/lectures/MiscFiles") : 
  cannot change working directory
```
